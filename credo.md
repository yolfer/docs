# Credo

1. All credos are incomplete. This one is a work in progress.
1. Sweat the petty stuff, it builds discipline. When your things are neat, you're always prepared & ready for action.
1. Understand the harm and benefit of everything.
1. Respect and understand people, so you can help them without getting fooled by them.
1. Learn how to learn and never stop learning: stay curious and humble.
1. To become aware of what isn't obvious, observe things with perspective: see nearby things like they're far away and vice versa.
1. Practice, drill, train, to get pretty good at a few things (instead of really good at one thing).
1. Wealth is not accumulated in the form of money, it's in love, health, and freedom. Optimise for those and money is irrelevant. 
1. The mind and body are inextricably linked. Exercise and eat right, to be strong/fast/healthy, to serve those with less privlege.
1. Wake up early in the morning and don't do anything useless throughout the day.
1. Always do your best.
