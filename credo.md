# Credo

## Main stuff

1. All credos are incomplete. This one is a work in progress.
1. Sweat the petty stuff, it builds discipline. When your things are neat, you're always prepared & ready for action.
1. Understand the harm and benefit of everything.
1. Respect and understand people, so you can help them without getting fooled by them.
1. Learn how to learn and never stop learning: stay curious and humble.
1. To become aware of what isn't obvious, observe things with perspective: see nearby things like they're far away and vice versa.
1. Practice, drill, train, to get pretty good at a few things (instead of really good at one thing).
1. Wealth is not accumulated in the form of money, it's in love, health, and freedom. Optimise for those and money is irrelevant. 
1. The mind and body are inextricably linked. Exercise and eat right, to be strong/fast/healthy, to serve those with less privlege.
1. Get enough sleep to wake up early in the morning, and don't do anything useless throughout the day.
1. Be suspicious of anything with a motor. A motor represents a shortcut to getting something done, but consider what you're shortcutting. [Muscle over motor](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/12/05/muscle-over-motor/) adds fun to your life while striping away the fat from your physique and your budget.  
1. Turn off all screens/devices for a 24 hour period each week
1. Always do your best.

## Parenting

1. Your child is uniqe and ordinary, accept them for who they are
1. You (and your parter) are to be respected at all times, in your childrens words and actions
1. Let your child take risks and make mistakes now, when they're young and the stakes are lower
1. Teach your child gratitude for what they have, by not giving them only what they need. Model gratitude in yourself
1. Give your children age-appropriate chores and encourage them to take initiative about helping out at home without being asked
1. Have a consistant discipline strategy (shared with your partner) that's loving but firm.
1. The dinner table is an alter of thanksgiving. Check your attitudes towards food/eating, and turn meals into a lesson on moderation, celebration and sanctification.
1. Children are born with long attention-spans, unspoiled by technology. Preserve that by entering their world, giving them long spans of your undivided attention.
1. Introduce your child to your spirituality, and let them choose their own path
